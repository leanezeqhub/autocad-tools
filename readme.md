Overview
AutoCAD Tools is designed to complement AutoCAD workflows with a focused set of utilities. The project emphasizes clarity, reliability, and smooth interaction with DWG files. It strives to minimize friction when moving between drafting tasks and 3D modeling tasks, while maintaining full compatibility with AutoCAD conventions.

This repository explores practical approaches to common CAD problems. It favors direct, readable solutions over cleverness for its own sake. The tools reflect real-world needs, such as accurate layer handling, consistent dimensioning, and robust object manipulation across both 2D and 3D contexts. The aim is steady improvement across releases, with clear notes on what changed and why it matters to users.
